Hi there! in this repository I added all Spark files for Spark version 3.1.3-hadoop 3.2
First you need to download that folder name spark-3.1.3-bin-hadoop-3.2
Then download winutils.exe,hadoop.dll and hadoop.lib files and paste this files to spark-3.1.3-bin-hadoop-3.2/bin
After that set file path in the system environment variables as "SPARK_HOME" and "HADOOP_HOME"
After that you have to set another aditional path in path variable like as an example "c:/spark-3.1.3-bin-hadoop-3.2/bin"
Now you all set to Run spark in your system. For check the spark version you have to open your Command Prompt and command spark-shell
